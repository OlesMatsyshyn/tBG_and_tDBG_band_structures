## Section A: Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG)

To generate the band structure for twisted bilayer graphene, run the script `TBG_BandStructure.m` in MATLAB.

### Relevant References:
The following papers were instrumental in the development and understanding of the TBG model:

- **A1.** [*Maximally Localized Wannier Orbitals and the Extended Hubbard Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene*, Physical Review X 8, 031087 (2018)](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.031087)

The MATLAB code heavily references Ref. [A1] and successfully reproduces FIG. 2a from this reference.

## Section B: Twisted Double Bilayer Graphene (TDBG)

The primary goal of this project was to develop code for twisted double-bilayer graphene (TDBG). The TBG code served as the foundation for this development. 

To generate the band structure for twisted double-bilayer graphene, run the script `TDBG_BandStructure.m` in MATLAB.
