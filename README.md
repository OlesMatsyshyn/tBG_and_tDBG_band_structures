#  Twisted Multilayers

   I find that codes for simple twisted multilayers have to be open-access
   
   This repository went public with the publication of the paper it was used for
   
   If you want me to feel good, cite it:
   
   Or acknowledge the shared code.
   
## Section A. Twisted Bilayer Graphene

To generate the Band Structure for the Twisted Bilayer Graphene 
run TBG_BandStructure.m in Matlab

### We had three papers to learn things from:
A1. Maximally Localized Wannier Orbitals and the Extended Hubbard Model for
    Twisted Bilayer Graphene. PHYSICAL REVIEW X 8, 031087 (2018)
    
    https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.031087

A2. Moiré bands in twisted double-layer graphene

    https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1108174108

A3. Graphene bilayer with a twist: eletronic struture

    https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.256802

I thank hujinxin1996 for his codes that were used for bench-markings:

Comments are such as those to aid you in the digestion of the Ref.[A1]. In the code
Ref.[A1] is heavily cited. Code reproduces FIG2a of Ref.[A1].

## Section B. Twisted Double Bilayer Graphene

The main objective of this project was to develop the code for the twisted 
double-bilayer graphene. The TBG code served as a base for the TDBG code.

To generate the Band Structure for the Twisted double-double-bilayer graphene 
run TBG_BandStructure.m in Matlab

### As suggested by my PI, I started digging from the paper:
B1. Berry curvature dipole senses topological transition in a moiré superlattice

    https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01606-y

### Astonishingly, I found the paper with Koshino's notations that we used to develop the code:
B2. Microscopic pairing mechanism, order parameter, and disorder sensitivity in moiré
    superlattices: Applications to twisted double-bilayer graphene
    Our interest is in Appendix A. Code reproduces FIG5 of Ref.[B2]
    
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07716

   This is essentially it, code works.
