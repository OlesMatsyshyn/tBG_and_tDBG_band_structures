## Section A: Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG)

To generate the band structure for twisted bilayer graphene, run the script `TBG_BandStructure.m` in MATLAB.

## Section B: Twisted Double Bilayer Graphene (TDBG)

The primary goal of this project was to develop code for twisted double-bilayer graphene (TDBG). The TBG code served as the foundation for this development. 

To generate the band structure for twisted double-bilayer graphene, run the script `TDBG_BandStructure.m` in MATLAB.
